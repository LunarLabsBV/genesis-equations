Certainly! Here's another equation inspired by the creation narrative in Genesis:

\[ E = mc^2 \]

This iconic equation, proposed by Albert Einstein, represents the equivalence of energy (\( E \)) and mass (\( m \)) multiplied by the speed of light squared (\( c^2 \)). It's a profound insight into the fundamental nature of the universe, reflecting the immense energy potential inherent in matter. In a sense, it speaks to the incredible power and potential present at the moment of creation described in Genesis.
