Sure, here's an equation inspired by the creation story in Genesis:

\[ F = \frac{{m_1 \cdot m_2}}{{r^2}} \]

This equation represents Newton's law of universal gravitation, \( F \), which describes the attractive force \( F \) between two objects with masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) separated by a distance \( r \). In a way, it reflects the idea of creation and the orderliness of the universe as described in Genesis.
